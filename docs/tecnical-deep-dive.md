# Technical Deep Dive

## Paper.js Integration with React


### Key Implementations

#### 1. Bezier Curve Calculations
Pattern curves require smooth, adjustable paths:
- Implemented cubic bezier interpolation
- Control point constraints for fashion-specific curves
- Tangent continuity for smooth joins

#### 2. Pattern Piece Relationships
- Parent-child relationships (e.g., facing attached to front)
- Constraint system for dependent measurements
- Automatic update propagation

#### 3. Geometric Algorithms
- **Parallel Curve Generation**: For seam allowances
- **Boolean Operations**: Union, intersection, difference
- **Point-in-Polygon Tests**: For selection and hit testing
- **Offset Algorithms**: For accurate seam allowance generation

## State Management Architecture

### Undo/Redo Implementation
- Immutable state updates
- Efficient diff algorithms
- Selective state persistence
- Memory-optimized history storage

## Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Rendering Pipeline
1. **Dirty Region Tracking**: Only redraw changed areas
2. **Layer Management**: Separate layers for grid, patterns, tools
3. **Request Animation Frame**: Smooth 60fps rendering
4. **WebGL Acceleration**: For complex patterns

### Large Pattern Handling
- Virtual viewport with culling
- Progressive detail loading
- Quadtree spatial indexing
- Efficient hit testing

## PDF Generation System

### Accuracy Requirements
- True 1:1 scale output
- Cross-platform consistency

- Professional plotter support



## Security Implementation

### API Security
- JWT with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Input validation with Joi
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### File Upload Security
- File type validation
- Size limits
- Virus scanning integration
- Sandboxed processing
- Secure URL generation
